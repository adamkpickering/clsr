clsr is a CLI tool that allows you to manage and study decks
of virtual flash cards. It takes care of scheduling so that you do not
review them more often than necessary. Similar to Anki and other
spaced repetition applications, except cards are always stored in
plain text. By doing this, we gain all the usual benefits of storing
data in plain text, such as scriptability and the ability to commit
data to version control.`,
